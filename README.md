The repository contains three base .tex files - zavrsni.tex, seminar.tex, diplomski.tex, which have a slight difference in content structure. 
Please leave only the base file that corresponds to your work, and delete the other two base .tex files. For example, if you are 
writing a Bachelor these leave zavrsni.tex, and delete both seminar.tex and diplomski.tex files.
