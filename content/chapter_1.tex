\section{Structure and formatting}
\label{sec:structure}
 
Recommended structure of your Latex project is as follows: 

\dirtree{%
.1 main folder.
	.2 content. 
		.3 {chapter1.tex}.
		.3 {chapter2.tex}.
	.2 figures.
		.3 source.
			.4 {experiment1.vsd}.
		.3 {experiment1.pdf}.
	.2 bibliography.
		.3 {mybibliography.bib}.
	.2 {main.tex}. 
}

Format the text according to WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) rule - separate paragraphs with a blank line; indent items in tabulated environments.

When uploading your project to a version control repository, upload only files which are necessary to 
generate the desired output file.
