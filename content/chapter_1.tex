\section{Structure and formatting}
\label{sec:structure}
 
Recommended structure of your Latex project is as follows: 

\dirtree{%
.1 main folder.
	.2 content. 
		.3 {chapter1.tex}.
		.3 {chapter2.tex}.
	.2 figures.
		.3 source.
			.4 {experiment1.vsd}.
		.3 {experiment1.pdf}.
	.2 bibliography.
		.3 {my\_bibliography.bib}.
	.2 {main.tex}. 
}

Format the text according to WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) rule - separate paragraphs with a blank line; indent items in tabulated environments.

When uploading your project to a version control repository, upload only files which are necessary to 
generate the desired output file, that is, .tex and .bib files, and figures. Other files generated during build should not be uploaded. For the given example only the files listed in tree structure should be uploaded (6 files in total). Use .gitignore to specify files that git should intentionally set as untracked.
